## Times Table Quiz

The **times-table-quiz** folder contains several quiz modes for
practicing multiplication tables from 13 to 19. Open `index.html` in a
browser to choose a mode:

- **Standard Mode** (`standard.html`) – a multiple choice quiz that runs
  through all questions once and displays your running score. Use the
  `1`–`4` keys as shortcuts for the answer buttons.
- **Infinity Mode** (`infinity.html`) – keeps generating new questions
  forever.
- **Calculator Mode** (`calculator.html`) – type the answer directly in
  the input box. It automatically focuses and only accepts digits.

Correct answers are shown in green and incorrect ones in red.
