## Times Table Quiz

The **times-table-quiz** folder contains several quiz modes for
practicing multiplication tables from 13 to 19. Open any of the HTML
files in a browser to play:

- `index.html` – multiple choice quiz that ends after all questions and
  shows a running score. Use the `1`–`4` keys as shortcuts for the
  answer buttons.
- `infinity.html` – multiple choice quiz that generates endless
  questions.
- `calculator.html` – type the answer instead of clicking a button.
  The input automatically focuses and only accepts digits.

Correct answers are shown in green and incorrect ones in red.
